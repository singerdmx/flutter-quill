## 📦 Installation

```shell
flutter pub add flutter_quill
```

<p align="center">OR</p>

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_quill:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill.git
      ref: v<latest-version-here>
```

> [!TIP]
> If you're using version `10.0.0`, see [the migration guide to migrate to `11.0.0`](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/blob/master/doc/migration/10_to_11.md).

## 🛠 Platform Setup

The `flutter_quill` package uses the following plugins:

1. [`url_launcher`](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher): to open links.
2. [`quill_native_bridge`](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_native_bridge): to access platform-specific APIs for the
   editor.
3. [`flutter_keyboard_visibility_temp_fork`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_keyboard_visibility_temp_fork) to listen for keyboard
   visibility changes.

### Android Configuration for `quill_native_bridge`

To support copying images to the clipboard to be accessed by other apps, you need to configure your Android project.
If not set up, a warning will appear in the log during debug mode only.

> [!TIP]
> This is only required on **Android** for this optional feature.
> You should be able to copy images and paste them inside the editor without any additional configuration.

**1. Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**

Open `your_project/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following inside the `<application>` tag:

```xml
<manifest>
    <application>
        ...
        <provider
            android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.fileprovider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true" >
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/file_paths" />
        </provider>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

**2. Create `file_paths.xml`**

Create the file `your_project/android/app/src/main/res/xml/file_paths.xml` with the following content:

```xml
<paths>
    <cache-path name="cache" path="." />
</paths>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Starting with Flutter Quill `10.8.4`, [super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard) is no longer required in `flutter_quill` or `flutter_quill_extensions`.
> The new default is an internal plugin [`quill_native_bridge`](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_native_bridge).
> If you want to continue using `super_clipboard`, you can use the [quill_super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_super_clipboard) package (support may be discontinued).

## 🚀 Usage

Add the localization delegate to your app widget:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill.dart';
import 'package:flutter_localizations/flutter_localizations.dart';

MaterialApp(
  localizationsDelegates: const [
    GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
    GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
    FlutterQuillLocalizations.delegate,
  ]，
);
```

Instantiate a controller:

```dart
QuillController _controller = QuillController.basic();
```

Use the `QuillEditor` and `QuillSimpleToolbar` widgets,
and attach the `QuillController` to them:

```dart
QuillSimpleToolbar(
  controller: _controller,
  config: const QuillSimpleToolbarConfig(),
),
Expanded(
  child: QuillEditor.basic(
    controller: _controller,
    config: const QuillEditorConfig(),
  ),
)
```

Dispose of the `QuillController` in the `dispose` method:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

Check out [Sample Page] for more advanced usage.

### 💥 Breaking Changes

- APIs marked with [`@experimental`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/experimental-constant.html) 
are subject to change or removal at any time and should be used with caution, 
as they may be altered even in minor versions.

- APIs marked with [`@internal`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/internal-constant.html)
and [`@visibleForTesting`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/visibleForTesting-constant.html) are not intended for
public use and should be avoided entirely.

- The `package:flutter_quill/internal.dart` expose internal APIs
to be used by other related packages and should be avoided when possible.

We make every effort to ensure internal APIs are not exported by default. Use experimental features at your own discretion.

We recommend checking the `CHANGELOG.md` or release notes for each update to stay informed.

## 🔤 Input / Output

This library utilizes [Quill Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/) to represent document content.
The Delta format is a compact and versatile method for describing document changes through a series of operations that denote insertions, deletions, or formatting changes.

* Use `_controller.document.toDelta()` to extract the deltas.
* Use `_controller.document.toPlainText()` to extract plain text.

To save the document as JSON:

```dart
final json = jsonEncode(_controller.document.toDelta().toJson());
```

To open an existing JSON representation that has been previously stored:

```dart
final json = jsonDecode(r'{"insert":"hello\n"}');

_controller.document = Document.fromJson(json);
```

and [this](https://www.flutterbeads.com/change-font-family-flutter/).

## 📦 Embed Blocks

The `flutter_quill` package provides an interface for all the users to provide their own implementations for embed
blocks.
Implementations for image, video, and
formula embed blocks are proved in a separate
package [`flutter_quill_extensions`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions).

### 🛠️ Using the embed blocks from `flutter_quill_extensions`

To see how to use the extension package, please take a look at the [README](./flutter_quill_extensions/README.md)
of [FlutterQuill Extensions]

## 🔄 Delta Conversion

> [!CAUTION]
> Storing the **Delta** as **HTML** in the database to convert it back to **Delta** when
> loading the document is not recommended due to the structural and functional differences between HTML and Delta ([see this comment](https://github.com/slab/quill/issues/1551#issuecomment-311458570)).
> We recommend storing the **Document** as **Delta JSON**
> instead of other formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown, PDF, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, XML).
>
> Converting **Delta** from/to **HTML** is not a standard feature in [Quill JS](https://github.com/slab/quill)
> or [FlutterQuill].

Available Packages for Conversion

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`vsc_quill_delta_to_html`](https://pub.dev/packages/vsc_quill_delta_to_html) | Converts **Delta** to **HTML**. |
| [`flutter_quill_delta_from_html`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_delta_from_html) | Converts **HTML** to **Delta**. |
| [`flutter_quill_to_pdf`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_to_pdf) | Converts **Delta** to **PDF**. |
| [`markdown_quill`](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown_quill) | Converts **Markdown** to **Delta** and vice versa. |
| [`flutter_quill_delta_easy_parser`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_delta_easy_parser) | Converts Quill **Delta** into a simplified document format, making it easier to manage and manipulate text attributes. |

> [!TIP]
> You might want to convert between **HTML** and **Delta** for some use cases:
>
> 1. **Migration**: If you're using an existing system that stores the data in HTML and want to convert the document
     data to **Delta**.
> 2. **Sharing**: For example, if you want to share the Document **Delta** somewhere or send it as an email.
> 3. **Save as**: If your app has a feature that allows converting Documents to other formats.
> 4. **Rich text pasting**: If you copy some content from websites or apps, and want to paste it into the app.
> 5. **SEO**: In case you want to use HTML for SEO support.

## 📝 Rich Text Paste

This feature allows the user to paste the content copied from other apps into the editor as rich text.
The plugin [`quill_native_bridge`](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_native_bridge) provides access to the system Clipboard.

    alt="An animated image of the rich text paste on macOS" width="600" />
</p>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently this feature is not supported on the web.
> See [issue #1998](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/1998) and [issue #2220](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/2220)
 for more details.

## ✂️ Shortcut events

We can customize some Shorcut events, using the parameters `characterShortcutEvents` or `spaceShortcutEvents` from `QuillEditorConfig` to add more functionality to the editor. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can get all standard shortcuts using `standardCharactersShortcutEvents` or `standardSpaceShorcutEvents`.

To see an example of this, refer to [shortcut events](./doc/customizing_shortcuts.md) page.

## 🌐 Translation

The package offers translations for the toolbar and editor widgets, it will follow the system locale unless you set your
own locale.

See the [translation](./doc/translation.md) page for more info.

## 🧪 Testing

Take a look at [flutter_quill_test](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_test) for testing.

Currently, the support for testing is limited.
