## 🛠 Platform Specific Configurations

The `flutter_quill` package uses the following plugins:

1. [`url_launcher`](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher) to open links.
2. [`quill_native_bridge`](https://pub.dev/packages/quill_native_bridge) to access platform-specific APIs for the
   editor.
3. [`flutter_keyboard_visibility`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_keyboard_visibility) to listen for keyboard
   visibility
   changes.

All of them don't require any platform-specific setup.

> [!NOTE]
> Starting from Flutter Quill `9.4.x`, [super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard) has been moved
> to [FlutterQuill Extensions], to use rich text pasting, support pasting images, and gif files from external apps or
> websites, take a look
> at `flutter_quill_extensions` Readme.

## 🚀 Usage

Instantiate a controller:

```dart
QuillController _controller = QuillController.basic();
```

Use the `QuillEditor`, and `QuillSimpleToolbar` widgets,
and attach the `QuillController` to them:

```dart
QuillSimpleToolbar(
  controller: _controller,
  configurations: const QuillSimpleToolbarConfigurations(),
),
Expanded(
  child: QuillEditor.basic(
    controller: _controller,
    configurations: const QuillEditorConfigurations(),
  ),
)
```

Dispose of the `QuillController` in the `dispose` method:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  _controller.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

Check out [Sample Page] for more advanced usage.

## 💥 Breaking Changes

- APIs marked with [`@experimental`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/experimental-constant.html) 
are subject to change or removal at any time and should be used with caution, 
as they may be altered even in minor versions.

- APIs marked with [`@internal`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/internal-constant.html)
and [`@visibleForTesting`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/visibleForTesting-constant.html) are not intended for
public use and should be avoided entirely.

- The `package:flutter_quill/flutter_quill_internal.dart` expose internal APIs
to be used by other related packages and should be avoided when possible.

We make every effort to ensure internal APIs are not exported by default. Use experimental features at your own discretion.

We recommend checking the `CHANGELOG.md` or release notes for each update to stay informed.

## 🔤 Input / Output

This library uses [Quill Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/)
to represent the document content.
The Delta format is a compact and versatile way to describe document changes.
It consists of a series of operations, each representing an insertion, deletion,
or formatting change within the document.

> [!NOTE]
> Don’t be confused by its name Delta—Deltas represents both documents and changes to documents.
> If you think of Deltas as the instructions for going from one document to another,
> the way Deltas represents a document is by expressing the instructions starting from an empty document.

* Use `_controller.document.toDelta()` to extract the deltas.
* Use `_controller.document.toPlainText()` to extract plain text.

To save a document as a JSON:

```dart
final json = jsonEncode(_controller.document.toDelta().toJson());
```

To open the editor with an existing JSON representation that you've previously stored:

```dart
final json = jsonDecode(r'{"insert":"hello\n"}');

_controller.document = Document.fromJson(json);
```

### 🖋 Font Family

To use your own fonts, update your [Assets](./example/assets/fonts) folder and pass in `fontFamilyValues`.

and [this](https://www.flutterbeads.com/change-font-family-flutter/).

## 📦 Embed Blocks

The `flutter_quill` package provides an interface for all the users to provide their own implementations for embed
blocks.
Implementations for image, video, and
formula embed blocks are proved in a separate
package [`flutter_quill_extensions`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions).

### 🛠️ Using the embed blocks from `flutter_quill_extensions`

To see how to use the extension package, please take a look at the [README](./flutter_quill_extensions/README.md)
of [FlutterQuill Extensions]

## 🔄 Conversion to HTML

> [!CAUTION]
> **Converting HTML or Markdown to Delta is highly experimental and shouldn't be used for production applications**,
> while the current implementation we have internally is far from perfect, it could improved however **it will likely
not
work as expected**, due to differences between **HTML** and **Delta**, see
> this [Quill JS Comment #311458570](https://github.com/slab/quill/issues/1551#issuecomment-311458570) for more
> info.<br>
> We only use it **internally** as it is more suitable for our specific use case, copying content from external websites
> and pasting it into the editor
> previously breaks the styles, while the current implementation is not designed for converting a **full Document** from
> other formats to **Delta**, it provides a better user experience and doesn't have many downsides.
>
> The support for converting HTML to **Quill Delta** is quite experimental and used internally when
> pasting HTML content from the clipboard to the Quill Document.
>
> Converting **Delta** from/to **HTML** is not a standard feature in [Quill JS](https://github.com/slab/quill)
> or [FlutterQuill].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Converting **HTML** to **Delta** usually won't work as expected, we highly recommend storing the **Document** as *
*Delta JSON**
> in the database instead of other formats (e.g., HTML, Markdown, PDF, Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Apple Pages, XML,
> CSV,
> etc...)
>
> Converting between **HTML** and **Delta** JSON is generally not recommended due to their structural and functional
> differences.
>
> Sometimes you might want to convert between **HTML** and **Delta** for specific use cases:
>
> 1. **Migration**: If you're using an existing system that stores the data in HTML and want to convert the document
     data to **Delta**.
> 2. **Sharing**: For example, if you want to share the Document **Delta** somewhere or send it as an email.
> 3. **Save as**: If your app has a feature that allows converting Documents to other formats.
> 4. **Rich text pasting**: If you copy some content from websites or apps, and want to paste it into the app.
> 5. **SEO**: In case you want to use HTML for SEO support.

The following packages can be used:

1. [`vsc_quill_delta_to_html`](https://pub.dev/packages/vsc_quill_delta_to_html): To convert **Delta**
   to **HTML**.
2. [`flutter_quill_delta_from_html`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_delta_from_html): To convert **HTML** to **Delta**.
3. [`flutter_quill_to_pdf`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_to_pdf): To convert **Delta** To **PDF**.
4. [`markdown_quill`](https://pub.dev/packages/markdown_quill): To convert **Markdown** To **Delta** and vice versa.

## 📝 Spelling checker

This feature is currently not implemented and is being planned. Refer to [#2246](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/issues/2246)
for discussion.

## ✂️ Shortcut events

We can customize some Shorcut events, using the parameters `characterShortcutEvents` or `spaceShortcutEvents` from `QuillEditorConfigurations` to add more functionality to our editor. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can get all standard shortcuts using `standardCharactersShortcutEvents` or `standardSpaceShorcutEvents` 

To see an example of this, you can check [customizing_shortcuts](./doc/customizing_shortcuts.md)

## 🌐 Translation

The package offers translations for the quill toolbar and editor, it will follow the system locale unless you set your
own locale.

Open this [page](./doc/translation.md) for more info

## 🧪 Testing

Take a look at [flutter_quill_test](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_test) for testing.

Notice that currently, the support for testing is limited.
