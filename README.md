<!-- Compatible versions:

| flutter_quill | Flutter | Dart  |

| 9.0.x         | 3.16.x  | 3.2.x |

These versions are tested and well-supported, you shouldn't get a build failure -->

## Usage

Before using the package, we must inform you the package use the following plugins:
  ```
  url_launcher
  flutter_keyboard_visibility
  device_info_plus
  super_clipboard
  ```

All of them doesn't require any platform spesefic setup, except [super_clipboard](https://pub.dev/packages/super_clipboard) which needs some setup on Android only, it's optional but to support copying images and pasting them into editor then you must setup it, open the page in pub.dev and read the `README.md` to get the instructions.

First, you need to instantiate a controller

```dart
QuillController _controller = QuillController.basic();
```

And then use the `QuillEditor`, `QuillToolbar` widgets,
connect the `QuillController` to them
using `QuillProvider` inherited widget

```dart
QuillToolbar.simple(
  configurations: QuillSimpleToolbarConfigurations(
    controller: _controller,
    sharedConfigurations: const QuillSharedConfigurations(
      locale: Locale('de'),
    ),
  ),
),
Expanded(
  child: QuillEditor.basic(
    configurations: QuillEditorConfigurations(
      controller: _controller,
      readOnly: false,
      sharedConfigurations: const QuillSharedConfigurations(
        locale: Locale('de'),
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

Depending on your use case, you might want to dispose of the `_controller` in `dispose` method

in most cases, it's better to.

Check out [Sample Page] for more advanced usage.

## Migration
Starting from version `8.0.0`
We have added [Migration Guide](/doc/migration.md) for migration from different versions

## Input / Output

This library uses [Quill Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/)
to represent the document content.
The Delta format is a compact and versatile way to describe document changes.
It consists of a series of operations, each representing an insertion, deletion,
or formatting change within the document.

Don’t be confused by its name Delta—Deltas represents both documents and changes to documents.
If you think of Deltas as the instructions for going from one document to another,
the way Deltas represents a document is by expressing the instructions starting from an empty document.

* Use `_controller.document.toDelta()` to extract the deltas.
* Use `_controller.document.toPlainText()` to extract plain text.

FlutterQuill provides some JSON serialization support so that you can save and open documents.
To save a document as JSON, do something like the following:

```dart
final json = jsonEncode(_controller.document.toDelta().toJson());
```

You can then write this to storage.

To open a FlutterQuill editor with an existing JSON representation that you've previously stored, 
you can do something like this:

```dart
final json = jsonDecode(r'{"insert":"hello\n"}');

_controller.document = Document.fromJson(json);
```

## Configurations

The `QuillToolbar` and `QuillEditor` widgets let you customize a lot of things
[Sample Page] provides sample code for advanced usage and configuration.

- [Font Size](./doc/configurations/font_size.md)
- [Font Family](#font-family)
- [Custom Toolbar buttons](./doc/configurations/custom_buttons.md)

### Font Family

To use your own fonts, update your [assets folder](./example/assets/fonts) and pass in `fontFamilyValues`.
More details on [this commit](https://github.com/singerdmx/flutter-quill/commit/71d06f6b7be1b7b6dba2ea48e09fed0d7ff8bbaa),
[this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55075834/fontfamily-property-not-working-properly-in-flutter) and [this](https://www.flutterbeads.com/change-font-family-flutter/).

## Embed Blocks

As of version 6.0, embed blocks are not provided by default as part of this package. Instead, this package provides an interface for all the users to provide their own implementations for embed blocks. Implementations for image, video, and formula embed blocks are proved in a separate package [`flutter_quill_extensions`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_extensions).

Provide a list of embed

### Using the embed blocks from `flutter_quill_extensions`

To see how to use the extension package, please take a look at the [README](./flutter_quill_extensions/README.md) of [FlutterQuill Extensions]

## Conversion to HTML

Having your document stored in Quill Delta format is sometimes not enough. Often you'll need to convert
it to other formats such as HTML to publish it, or send an email.

**Note**: This package support converting from HTML back to Quill delta but it's experimental and used internally when pasting Html content from the cliboard to the Quill Editor

You have two options:

1. Using [quill_html_converter](./quill_html_converter/) to convert to HTML, the package can convert the Quill delta to HTML well
(it uses [vsc_quill_delta_to_html](https://pub.dev/packages/vsc_quill_delta_to_html)), it just a handy extension to do it more quickly
1. Another option is to use
[vsc_quill_delta_to_html](https://pub.dev/packages/vsc_quill_delta_to_html) to convert your document
to HTML.
   This package has full support for all Quill operations—including images, videos, formulas,
tables, and mentions.
   Conversion can be performed in vanilla Dart (i.e., server-side or CLI) or in Flutter.
It is a complete Dart part of the popular and mature [quill-delta-to-html](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quill-delta-to-html)
Typescript/Javascript package.
   this package doesn't convert the HTML back to Quill Delta as far as we know

## Translation

The package offers translations for the quill toolbar and editor, it will follow the system locale unless you set your own locale.

Open this [page](./doc/translation.md) for more info

## Testing

Please use [flutter_quill_test](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill_test) for testing
